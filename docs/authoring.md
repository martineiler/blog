# Article Authoring Guidelines

> **Status: stub — to be completed after the first build.**
>
> These guidelines depend on the behaviour of the markdown pipeline as
> actually implemented. Fill this document in once the build is running
> and the rendering of each element (diagrams, code blocks, tables, etc.)
> has been verified.

## What to document here

- `.md` filename convention
- Required and optional frontmatter fields (already in CLAUDE.md — summarise here)
- Article structure: opening, heading depth, closing
- Tone and voice
- Rough length expectations
- How to write and introduce mermaid diagrams
- Supported mermaid diagram types with examples
- Code block language identifiers (Shiki)
- GFM features in use: tables, strikethrough, task lists
- What *not* to do (images, raw HTML, unsupported syntax)
