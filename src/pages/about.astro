      I work at the intersection of technology strategy, platform architecture, and enterprise AI.
      For the past decade I have been helping large organisations navigate the shift from
      traditional IT to modern platform thinking — and more recently, to AI-native ways of working.
    </p>

      This blog is where I think out loud. The writing covers enterprise AI adoption, platform
      and infrastructure design, and the organisational dynamics that shape how technology
      actually gets built and used at scale.

      I am based in Copenhagen.
