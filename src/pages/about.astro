          Founder and former CTO based in Copenhagen. For the past decade I have been working
          at the intersection of technology strategy, platform architecture, and enterprise AI —
          helping large organisations navigate the shift from traditional IT to modern ways of
          building and operating software.

          I am now building something new. The problems I spent years solving for others —
          how to adopt AI meaningfully, how to build platforms that actually serve their users,
          how to make technology strategy legible to the rest of the business — remain the
          problems I find most interesting.

        This blog is where I think out loud. The writing covers enterprise AI adoption,
        platform and infrastructure design, and the organisational dynamics that shape how
        technology actually gets built and used at scale. I write the way I think — directly,
        with a preference for the structural over the superficial.

        All articles on this site are written by Claude as a deliberate experiment in
        AI-assisted publishing. The ideas, positions, and opinions are mine. The prose is
        a collaboration.
